# Anchoring Effect Analysis

This project investigates the **anchoring effect**, a cognitive bias where people rely heavily on initial numerical values (anchors) when making estimates. Using replicated data from Chandler (2015), based on Janiszewski and Uy (2008), we analyze how **anchor precision** and **motivation to underestimate** affect estimation behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: Chandler (2015) replication study
- **Structure**: Participants estimated values for 9 items (e.g., price, weight) under one of four experimental conditions:
  - Low vs. high anchor precision
  - Weak vs. strong motivational phrasing

## ðŸ§ª Methods

- Relative difference from anchor was calculated per item and averaged per participant
- A **Two-Way ANOVA** tested main and interaction effects of anchor precision and motivation
- **Shapiro-Wilk** and **Leveneâ€™s Test** checked model assumptions
- **Tukey's HSD** explored pairwise differences across 4 conditions

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- High precision anchors led to estimates closer to the anchor
- Strong motivation led to larger underestimation
- No significant interaction effect was found

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python
- pandas, seaborn, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib
